/**
 * Sets the height of the statistics-box component to utilize the available vertical space effectively. 
 * The height calculation deducts the heights of various elements from the total viewport height (100vh), 
 * ensuring that the statistics-box does not extend beyond the visible area, avoiding unnecessary page scrolling.
 * 
 * Breakdown of height deductions:
 * - Navbar: 40px
 * - Card Header: 50px
 * - Additional vertical padding (py-3 class): 1.5rem
 *
 * The overflow-y: auto property enables vertical scrolling within the .statistics-box if the content inside 
 * exceeds the available height.
