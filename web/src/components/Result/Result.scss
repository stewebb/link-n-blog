/**
 * Adjusts the height of the result-box component. The total height is calculated by subtracting the 
 * cumulative height of other UI elements from the full viewport height (100vh). This ensures that the 
 * result-box fits perfectly in the remaining visible vertical space without causing the entire page to scroll.
 * 
 * Breakdown of height deductions:
 * - Navbar: 40px
 * - Card Header: 50px
 * - Top and bottom padding within card: 3rem
 * - Additional fixed space (possibly for other UI elements): 325px
 *
 * The overflow-y: auto property allows for vertical scrolling within the .result-box if the content exceeds 
 * the calculated height.
